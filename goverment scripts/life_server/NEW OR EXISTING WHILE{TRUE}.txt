//This is to be added in an existing while{true} loop on a 1 hour sleep schedule. If you can't find one, make a new one like below such as at the bottom of init.sqf: 

[] spawn { 
	while{true} do {
		sleep 3600;
		_query = "UPDATE rules SET time=time+1";
		[_query,1] call DB_fnc_asyncCall;
	}; 
};

//Otherwise just add the inner contents of that while loop to your existing 1 hour sleep loop.

//This loop is here to keep track of how much time the governor has been in office, and selecting a new one after x amount of hours have passed
