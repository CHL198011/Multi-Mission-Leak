				<Original>With the release of the Marksmen DLC and it's features such as weapons resting and deployment, we've decided to &lt;t color='%1'&gt;trial&lt;/t&gt; a couple of somewhat &lt;t color='%1'&gt;controversial changes&lt;/t&gt;.</Original>

The main reason behind this change is to prevent potentially exploitive methods of gameplay while also enforcing a &lt;t color='%1'&gt;richer combat experience&lt;/t&gt;.</Original>

			<Key ID="STR_GTA_WELCOME_MARK_PARA3">
				<Original>We're giving our players the oppurtinity to &lt;t color='%1'&gt;decide&lt;/t&gt; the overall outcome of this change, so please cast your vote &lt;a href='http://www.poll-maker.com/poll287515x97879BDe-11' color='%1' underline='true'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.</Original>

				<Original>The second change being made is the &lt;t color='%1'&gt;removal&lt;/t&gt; of &lt;t color='%1'&gt;redbull&lt;/t&gt; from the game. Players will now have to take their &lt;t color='%1'&gt;equipment load&lt;/t&gt; into consideration as it will directly affect their fatigue when moving. &lt;br/&gt;A &lt;t color='%1'&gt;guide&lt;/t&gt; is in the works to help you manage your equipment load and fatigue effectively, so stay tuned on the &lt;a href='http://grandtheftarma.com' color='%1' underline='true'&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt;!</Original>
